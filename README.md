# Overview of functionality
The Chatting solution is currently able to host a chatroom. It allows for a user to set their display name once upon connecting using their
first message sent. This display name is shown as a prefix to all their chat messages. It allows multiple people to connect concurrently. 
The Chatting solution is also instrumented with extensive logging in Server, NetworkConnections, and ChatServer for debugging purposes.

The chatting solution also contains a networked Snake game. It handles all client side operations such as receiving info from the server,
displaying the info, and sending client movement info. 

# Notes for Grader
Ended up going with a 500x500 canvas because 1000x1000 was too large to fit on our screens.
